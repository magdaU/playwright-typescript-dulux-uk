# Dulux E2E Tests — Playwright + TypeScript

End-to-end tests for [dulux.co.uk](https://www.dulux.co.uk) built with [Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/) and TypeScript.

[![View Allure Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/Allure%20Report-View%20latest%20results-orange?logo=qameta&logoColor=white)](https://magdau.github.io/playwright-ts-dulux/)

The project produces [Allure](https://allurereport.org/) test reports that are generated and published automatically
to **GitHub Pages** on every run on `main`. Click the badge above (or [this link](https://magdau.github.io/playwright-ts-dulux/))
to open the latest test results — no setup required.

See [TEST_STRATEGY.md](TEST_STRATEGY.md) for the approach behind this suite — scope, tagging, environments,
risk-based prioritisation, and what's intentionally out of scope.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Running with Docker

No local Node/browser setup needed — [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) is based on Microsoft's official
[`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright`](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/playwright/about) image, which ships
Node.js and browsers pre-installed and version-matched to `@playwright/test`, so the container needs no
`playwright install` step of its own.

```bash
docker build -t dulux-e2e .
docker run --rm dulux-e2e                                    # run the full suite (api + desktop + mobile)
docker run --rm dulux-e2e npx playwright test --project=api  # just the API checks
docker run --rm dulux-e2e npx playwright test --grep @smoke  # just the smoke tests
```

## Running tests

```bash
npm test                              # run the full suite (api + desktop + mobile projects)
npm run test:headed                   # run with a visible browser
npm run test:smoke                    # run tests tagged @smoke
npm run test:desktop                  # run only the desktop-chrome project
npm run test:mobile                   # run only the mobile-chrome project
npm run test:api                      # run only the API precondition checks (no browser)
npm run test:trace                    # force a full trace for every test (for debugging/Trace Viewer demos)
npm run report                        # open the last Playwright HTML report
npx playwright show-trace <path>      # open a captured trace.zip in the Trace Viewer
```

## Allure reporting

Test runs are also recorded as [Allure](https://allurereport.org/) results (via `allure-playwright`) for richer
reporting — history, severity, steps and attachments per test.

```bash
npm test                  # generates raw results into allure-results/
npm run allure:generate   # builds the static HTML report into allure-report/
npm run allure:open       # opens the generated report in a browser
npm run allure:serve      # generates and serves the report in one step
```

### Allure report on GitHub Pages

On every push to `main`, the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`):
1. runs the Playwright suite — the full `@regression` suite (both desktop and mobile scenarios) by default;
   `workflow_dispatch` lets you target a narrower tag (e.g. `@smoke`) via the `grep` input,
2. enriches the raw results before generating the report:
   - **History/Trend** — checks out the previously published report from `gh-pages` and restores its
     `history/` folder into `allure-results/`, so the **Trends** widget builds up a pass/fail/duration graph
     across runs instead of resetting every time,
   - **Environment** — writes `allure-results/environment.properties` (target URL, browsers, OS, branch, commit)
     so the report's **Environment** widget shows what the run actually covered,
   - **Executors** — writes `allure-results/executor.json` linking the report back to the GitHub Actions run
     that produced it (build number, build URL, report URL), shown in the **Executors** widget,
   - **Categories** — copies the project's defect taxonomy from [`allure/categories.json`](allure/categories.json)
     (Product defects / Test-locator defects / Timeouts / Flaky-passed-on-retry) into `allure-results/`, so
     failures land in the **Categories** tab pre-classified instead of as one undifferentiated pile,
3. generates the Allure report from the enriched results (`npm run allure:generate`),
4. uploads the raw `allure-results/` as a build artifact, and
5. publishes the generated `allure-report/` to the `gh-pages` branch via `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`,
   which GitHub Pages then serves at https://magdau.github.io/playwright-ts-dulux/

To view it: open the link above, or check the **Actions** tab → latest run on `main` → download the
`playwright-report` / `allure-results` artifacts to inspect locally.

To reproduce the same report locally:

```bash
npm test
npm run allure:generate
npm run allure:open      # or: npm run allure:serve
```

`npm run allure:generate` always copies the project's `allure/categories.json` into the results first, so the
**Categories** tab is classified locally too. **Trends**, **Environment** and **Executors** are populated only
in CI, where the previous report's history and the build context (URL, branch, commit, GitHub Actions run) are
actually available — running locally just won't show those widgets.

## Test cases

### Tester Product — add a colour tester to the basket
`tests/specs/purchase/tester-product.spec.ts` (`@purchase @regression`)

1. Open the cart page and reject all cookies.
2. Verify the basket is empty.
3. Open the home page.
4. Open the "Find a colour" navigation item.
5. Click "Find a colour" to go to the colour finder.
6. Choose the colour family "Violet".
7. Choose the specific shade "Sugared Lilac".
8. Click "Buy a Tester in this colour".
9. Close the confirmation alert.
10. Open the shopping cart.
11. Verify the quantity field is visible and equals "1".
12. Verify the basket shows "Dulux Colour Tester" and the shade "Sugared Lilac".
13. Take a screenshot of the basket.

**Mobile — `@mobile`:** *mobile customer adds a tester to the basket via the hamburger menu*
1. Open the cart page and reject all cookies.
2. Verify the basket is empty.
3. Open the home page.
4. Open the hamburger menu.
5. Open the "Find a colour" navigation item.
6. Click "Find a colour" to go to the colour finder.

14. Take a screenshot of the basket.

### Locators & assertions showcase
`tests/specs/showcase/locators-and-assertions.spec.ts` (`@showcase @regression @desktop`)

A reference suite (no purchase flow) that demonstrates the locator and assertion styles used across the project:
1. **Role-based locators** — find the "Find a colour" button and "Shopping Cart" link by their accessible role + name, and assert they're visible/enabled.
2. **Text locators** — find the "I have some colours in mind" call-to-action by its rendered text and assert its exact text content.
3. **Count assertions** — assert how many "Bathroom" buttons and list items appear on the page (`toHaveCount`).
4. **Page-level assertions** — navigate to the colour finder and assert the URL and title update (`toHaveURL`, `toHaveTitle`), auto-retrying until the navigation settles.

### Trace Viewer & parallel tests showcase
`tests/specs/showcase/trace-and-parallel.spec.ts` (`@showcase @regression @desktop`)

Two independent, single-step checks (home page navigation, empty cart) used to demonstrate:
1. **Trace Viewer** — `test.use({ trace: 'on' })` forces a full trace for every run of this file (rather than the project-wide `on-first-retry`), and each test is broken into named `test.step()` actions so the recording is easy to follow in `npx playwright show-trace`.
2. **Parallel Tests** — `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' })` marks the two tests as independent so Playwright runs them concurrently across workers, on top of the project-wide `fullyParallel: true` default.

### Test runner config showcase
`tests/specs/showcase/test-runner-config.spec.ts` (`@showcase @regression @desktop`)

Four independent checks demonstrating the per-test/per-suite knobs Playwright Test layers on top of `playwright.config.ts`:
1. **Per-test timeout** — `test.setTimeout(60_000)` gives one slow check more time without changing the suite-wide default.
2. **Conditional skip** — `test.skip(!!process.env.CI, reason)` skips an expensive check in CI (with the reason recorded in the report) while still running it locally.
3. **Soft assertions** — `expect.soft()` checks the hero button, cart link and call-to-action in one pass and reports every failure, instead of stopping at the first.
4. **Annotations** — `testInfo.annotations.push({ type, description })` attaches a note to the test that's visible in the HTML/Allure report.

### Parallel Tests — summary

Parallelism shows up at three levels in this project, smallest to largest:

| Level | Mechanism | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Within a file | `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' })` opts independent tests in the same file into concurrent execution | `tests/specs/showcase/trace-and-parallel.spec.ts` |
| Across a project | `fullyParallel: true` runs every test file in its own worker by default | `playwright.config.ts` |
| Across projects | The `api`, `desktop-chrome` and `mobile-chrome` projects run side by side, each with its own browser/device/storage-state setup | `playwright.config.ts` `projects` |

Locally, `workers` is left at Playwright's default (CPU-core based) for maximum speed; in CI it's capped at `2`
(`workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : undefined`) to stay within the runner's resources, with `retries: 2` to absorb
flakiness from a real, uncontrolled production site.

## Common Playwright building blocks — where they're used here

The table below maps the concepts that show up in most Playwright projects to where each one is actually
applied in this repo. Every concept listed here is implemented — each one was built out on its own
feature branch, one concept at a time, so the table doubles as a tour of the project's history.

| Concept | Where it's applied | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Test runner** (Playwright Test — TS equivalent of JUnit/TestNG) | `playwright.config.ts`, every file in `tests/specs/**`; per-test config knobs showcased in `tests/specs/showcase/test-runner-config.spec.ts` | Native runner: `test.describe`, tagged `test()`, hooks via fixtures instead of `@BeforeEach`/`@AfterEach`, plus `test.setTimeout()`, `test.skip(condition, reason)`, `expect.soft()` and `testInfo.annotations` for fine-grained per-test control |
| **Browser Contexts** | `tests/fixtures.ts` (each test gets an isolated `page`/context from Playwright Test), `playwright.config.ts` `projects` (`desktop-chrome` vs `mobile-chrome` carry distinct viewport/device contexts) | No shared cookies/storage between tests — each journey starts clean |
| **Storage State** | `tests/setup/global-setup.ts` + `playwright.config.ts` (`globalSetup`, `use.storageState`) | Cookie-consent is accepted **once** before the whole suite runs and persisted to `playwright/.auth/storage-state.json`; every test then starts already past the consent banner — no repeated `rejectAllCookies()` calls |
| **API Setup** | `tests/specs/setup/api-setup.spec.ts`, runs in its own `api` project (no browser) | Uses Playwright's `request` fixture / `APIRequestContext` to verify the home page and cart page respond with a 2xx **before** the full UI journey runs — a fast precondition check that doesn't need a browser |
| **Locators** | `tests/pages/*.ts`, `tests/components/*.ts`, showcased end-to-end in `tests/specs/showcase/locators-and-assertions.spec.ts` | Role/text-first locators: `getByRole`, `getByText`, plus `filter({ hasText })` and chaining (e.g. `ColorSelectionPage.openVisualizerApp()`) |
| **Assertions** | `tests/specs/purchase/tester-product.spec.ts`, `tests/specs/showcase/locators-and-assertions.spec.ts` | Web-first, auto-retrying assertions: `toBeVisible()`, `toBeEnabled()`, `toHaveText()`, `toHaveValue()`, `toHaveCount()`, and page-level `toHaveURL()` / `toHaveTitle()` |
| **Trace Viewer** | `playwright.config.ts` (`trace: 'on-first-retry'`, `screenshot: 'only-on-failure'`, `video: 'retain-on-failure'`); showcased in `tests/specs/showcase/trace-and-parallel.spec.ts` (`test.use({ trace: 'on' })` + `test.step()`), runnable via `npm run test:trace` | Traces are captured on retry by default (and uploaded as part of the Playwright HTML report in CI for failure diagnosis), or forced for every run with `--trace on` when you actually want to inspect one (`npx playwright show-trace`) |
| **Parallel Tests** | `playwright.config.ts` (`fullyParallel: true`, `workers: process.env.CI ? 2 : undefined`); showcased in `tests/specs/showcase/trace-and-parallel.spec.ts` (`test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' })`) | Desktop and mobile projects run as independent, parallel jobs by default, and independent tests within a single file can be marked safe to run concurrently too |

See [TEST_STRATEGY.md](TEST_STRATEGY.md) for the reasoning behind these choices.
